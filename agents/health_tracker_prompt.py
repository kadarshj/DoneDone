Collect the relevant health metrics and format them into a JSON object. Each metric should be a key in the object, 
with its value being another object containing 'value' (the measurement) and 'unit' (the unit of measurement). 
Additionally, include a 'timestamp' key with the time when the metrics were measured, in ISO 8601 format. 
For example:
{
  "weight": {"value": 150, "unit": "pounds"},
  "height": {"value": 65, "unit": "inches"},
  "timestamp": "2023-10-01T12:00:00Z"
}

Ensure that the metric names are appropriate for the data being collected (e.g., 'weight', 'height', 'blood_pressure', 'heart_rate'), 
and that the units are consistent and accurate (e.g., 'pounds' or 'kilograms' for weight, 'inches' or 'centimeters' for height)."
